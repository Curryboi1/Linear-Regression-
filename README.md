# Linear-Regression- project description 

# Congratulations! You recently received a contract with an online retailer with headquarters in New York City that offers both in-person style consultations and clothes guidance in addition to online clothing sales. Customers visit the store, meet with a personal stylist during sessions or meetings, and then leave the store to get the garments they want online or through a mobile app.
# The business is debating whether to concentrate its efforts on the mobile app experience or its website. You've been given a contract to assist them in figuring it out.
